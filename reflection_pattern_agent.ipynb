This makes it difficult to extend or modify the game's vocabulary without directly altering the code.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling for Empty Input:** The code checks for non-alphabetic input and input with length not equal to 1, but it doesn't explicitly handle the case where the user enters an empty string.\n*   **Limited User Feedback:** The game provides basic feedback, but it could be enhanced with visual elements (e.g., a simple hangman drawing that progresses with each incorrect guess) to improve the user experience.\n*   **No Replayability:** The game ends after one round. There's no built-in mechanism to play again without rerunning the script.\n*   **Missing Docstrings:** While the functions have docstrings, the code could benefit from a more comprehensive docstring at the module level, briefly describing the purpose of the script.\n*   **Repetitive Output:** The `display_word` function is called multiple times within the loop, leading to some repetition in the output.\n*   **No Difficulty Levels:** The game has a fixed difficulty. Introducing difficulty levels (e.g., based on word length or number of allowed attempts) could make it more engaging.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Externalize Word List:** Store the word list in a separate file (e.g., a text file) and load it into the program. This makes it easier to add, remove, or modify words without changing the core code.\n*   **Handle Empty Input:** Add an explicit check for empty input and provide an appropriate message to the user.\n*   **Enhance User Interface:** Consider adding a visual representation of the hangman figure using ASCII art or a library like `pygame` for a more graphical experience.\n*   **Implement Replayability:** After the game ends (win or lose), ask the user if they want to play again.\n*   **Add Module-Level Docstring:** Include a docstring at the beginning of the file to describe the overall purpose of the script.\n*   **Reduce Repetitive Output:** Store the result of `display_word` in a variable and reuse it where needed to avoid redundant calls.\n*   **Introduce Difficulty Levels:** Allow the user to select a difficulty level, which could influence the length of the words chosen or the number of attempts allowed.\n*   **Consider Using Constants:** Define the maximum number of attempts as a constant to improve readability and maintainability.\n*   **Separate Game Logic from Input/Output:** Consider refactoring the code to separate the core game logic (e.g., checking guesses, updating the game state) from the input/output operations (e.g., printing messages, getting user input). This can improve testability and maintainability.\n*   **Use f-strings consistently:** Use f-strings for all string formatting for consistency.\n*   **Consider using a class:** Encapsulate the game state and logic within a class to improve organization and allow for more complex features in the future."

            "**Critiques:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Limited Word List:** The `choose_word` function has a small, hardcoded list of words. This makes the game repetitive after a few plays.\n",
            "*   **No Visual Hangman:** The game lacks a visual representation of the hangman figure being drawn as the player makes incorrect guesses. This is a common and engaging element of Hangman.\n",
            "*   **Basic Input Validation:** The input validation only checks for single letters. It doesn't handle non-alphanumeric characters effectively (e.g., symbols, numbers).\n",
            "*   **No Game Restart Option:** Once the game ends (win or lose), there's no option to play again without rerunning the script.\n",
            "*   **Lack of Difficulty Levels:** The game has a fixed difficulty. It would be better to have difficulty levels based on word length or the number of allowed attempts.\n",
            "*   **No Clear Win/Loss Messages:** While there are messages, they could be more descriptive and engaging.\n",
            "*   **Missing Docstrings:** While some functions have docstrings, the `display_word` function's docstring could be more descriptive.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Recommendations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Expand Word List:**\n",
            "    *   Read words from a file. This allows for easy expansion of the word list without modifying the code.\n",
            "    *   Consider using an online dictionary API (though this adds complexity with API keys and network requests).\n",
            "*   **Implement Visual Hangman:**\n",
            "    *   Create a list of strings representing the different stages of the hangman figure.\n",
            "    *   Print the appropriate stage based on the number of incorrect guesses.\n",
            "*   **Improve Input Validation:**\n",
            "    *   More robustly handle invalid input (non-letters, empty strings, etc.). Provide more informative error messages.\n",
            "*   **Add Game Restart:**\n",
            "    *   After the game ends, ask the player if they want to play again.\n",
            "*   **Implement Difficulty Levels:**\n",
            "    *   Allow the player to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).\n",
            "    *   Adjust the word length or the number of allowed attempts based on the chosen difficulty.\n",
            "*   **Enhance Win/Loss Messages:**\n",
            "    *   Make the win/loss messages more celebratory or commiserating.\n",
            "*   **Add Docstrings:**\n",
            "    *   Add more descriptive docstrings to all functions and the module itself.\n",
            "*   **Consider Using Constants:**\n",
            "    *   Define the maximum number of attempts as a constant for better readability and maintainability.\n",
            "*   **Separate Game Logic from UI:**\n",
            "    *   While this is a simple game, consider separating the core game logic (word selection, guess checking) from the user interface (input/output). This makes the code more modular and testable.\n",
            "*   **Handle Uppercase/Lowercase Consistently:**\n",
            "    *   Convert the chosen word to lowercase at the beginning to avoid case-sensitivity issues.\n",
            "*   **Use f-strings consistently:**\n",

            "🧐 Critique:\n",
            "Here's a critique of the updated Hangman game code, along with further recommendations:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Critiques:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Global Variable:** The `MAX_ATTEMPTS` is defined in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, making it effectively a global variable. While it works, it's generally better to avoid globals if possible.\n",
            "*   **Inconsistent Use of f-strings:** While the code uses f-strings in some places, it's not consistently applied throughout.\n",
            "*   **Hangman Display After Correct Guess:** The hangman display is shown even after a correct guess, which isn't ideal. It should only be updated on incorrect guesses.\n",
            "*   **Word File Handling:** The code attempts to read from \"words.txt\" but falls back to a default list if the file isn't found. This is good, but it could be improved by allowing the user to specify the word file path.\n",
            "*   **No Difficulty Levels:** The previous recommendation to implement difficulty levels hasn't been addressed.\n",
            "*   **Limited Input Validation:** The input validation is still basic. It doesn't prevent the user from entering spaces or other non-alphanumeric characters that might cause unexpected behavior.\n",
            "*   **Docstring for `display_hangman` could be improved:** It doesn't describe what the function *does* as clearly as it could.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Recommendations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Encapsulate `MAX_ATTEMPTS`:** Pass `MAX_ATTEMPTS` as an argument to the `hangman` function. This avoids the need for a global variable.\n",
            "*   **Consistent f-strings:** Use f-strings for all string formatting to improve readability and consistency.\n",
            "*   **Conditional Hangman Display:** Only call `display_hangman` when `attempts_left` is decremented (i.e., after an incorrect guess).\n",
            "*   **Word File Path Input:** Allow the user to specify the word file path as a command-line argument or through an input prompt.\n",
            "*   **Implement Difficulty Levels:** Add a difficulty selection at the beginning of the game. This could affect the length of the word chosen or the number of allowed attempts.\n",
            "*   **Robust Input Validation:** Use a regular expression to validate that the input is a single letter.\n",
            "*   **Improve `display_hangman` Docstring:**  Reword the docstring to clearly state the function's purpose: \"Displays the hangman figure corresponding to the number of incorrect attempts remaining.\"\n",
            "*   **Consider a Class:** For a more object-oriented approach, you could encapsulate the game state (word, guessed letters, attempts left) within a class. This would make the code more organized and easier to extend.\n",
            "*   **Clear the Screen:** Consider clearing the console screen between guesses to make the game more visually appealing.  This can be done using `os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')`.  Be mindful of portability when using this.\n",
            "*   **Add a \"Hint\" Feature:** Implement a feature that reveals a letter after a certain number of incorrect guesses.\n",
            "*   **Consider Using `argparse`:** If you implement the word file path as a command-line argument, use the `argparse` module for more robust argument parsing.\n",
